**PyRat** is a low-difficulty **TryHackMe** machine emulating a **Python**-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) operating on an open port. The challenge revolves around exfiltrating a **GitHub** account token to acquire the PyRat source code. By dissecting the source code, you can delve into the RAT's inner workings  and potentially identify vulnerabilities that could lead to root **privilege escalation**.
